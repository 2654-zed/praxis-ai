# Praxis

Praxis is a backend orchestration engine that plans, evaluates, and executes workflows across multiple AI tools. It treats tools as interchangeable execution units and uses decision logic, scoring, and constraints to determine optimal pipelines.

## How It Works

Praxis has five core components that form a request pipeline:

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| **Decision Engine** | Evaluates tool options and ranks execution paths using multi-signal scoring (keyword match, category fit, TF-IDF, profile fit, industry boost, popularity, vendor risk) |
| **Tool Registry** | Structured metadata for 246 AI tools — capabilities, pricing, integrations, compliance tags, stack roles, limitations, and data handling practices |
| **Planner** | Builds execution pipelines from user intent. Supports single-tool recommendations, multi-tool stacks, and agentic Plan→Act→Observe→Reflect loops |
| **Execution Layer** | Routes queries through hybrid retrieval (BM25 + dense + Reciprocal Rank Fusion), knowledge graph traversal, PRISM multi-agent search, and vertical constraint enforcement |
| **Trace Layer** | Every reasoning step is recorded — sub-questions, scoring signals, agent critiques, constraint applications, and explanation narratives — all inspectable |

### Request Flow

## How to Think About Praxis

Praxis behaves like several well-understood backend systems at once. These are architectural parallels, not branding metaphors.

**Query planner** — Like a database query planner, Praxis receives a high-level intent and determines the most efficient execution strategy across available tools, applying cost estimates and constraint checks before committing to a path.

**Compiler** — Like a compiler turning source code into executable instructions, the Planner converts unstructured user intent into a structured, ordered pipeline of tool calls with typed inputs and expected outputs.

**Air traffic control** — Like an ATC system coordinating independent aircraft, the Execution Layer routes concurrent tool operations safely, handles retries on failure, and prevents conflicting tool combinations from being recommended to the same user.

As AI tooling ecosystems expand, manual tool selection becomes increasingly inefficient. Praxis explores automated planning, evaluation, and orchestration as a systems-level solution to this emerging complexity.

---

## Engineering Principles

These are the invariants the codebase is built around:

- **Deterministic execution paths where possible** — Scoring functions are pure. Given identical inputs, the engine produces identical rankings. LLM calls are isolated to the interpreter and reasoning layers; they do not touch scoring.
- **Inspectable reasoning traces** — Every recommendation can be traced back to its scoring signals, constraint applications, and agent sub-steps. Nothing is a black box.
- **Tool abstraction over vendor coupling** — Tools are metadata records in a registry, not hardcoded integrations. Adding, removing, or repricing a tool requires no application code changes.
- **Failure-aware orchestration design** — The execution layer applies fallback strategies when retrieval or reasoning steps fail. Guardrails run as a chain-of-responsibility pipeline, not a single gate.
- **Pipeline composability over hardcoded flows** — Retrieval, reasoning, graph traversal, and vertical enrichment are independent modules that compose. Any combination can be enabled or disabled per request.
- **Zero external ML dependencies** — All NLP (synonym expansion, TF-IDF, BM25, Levenshtein, multi-intent parsing), graph operations (community detection, traversal), and dense retrieval are implemented in pure Python. No PyTorch, no transformers, no NumPy required.

                         157 total — all passing
```

Run with:
```bash
python -m pytest praxis/tests/ -v
```

**Important:** Delete `praxis/tools.db` before running tests if tool counts seem wrong — this is a stale SQLite cache issue.

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+ (developed on 3.14.3)
- (Optional) OpenAI or Anthropic API key for LLM-powered interpretation

### Install

```bash
pip install -e .

# Optional: LLM support
pip install openai anthropic
```

### CLI

```bash
praxis
# or
python -m praxis.main
```

### API Server

```bash
uvicorn praxis.api:app --reload --port 8000
# or on Windows:
run_api.bat
```

Open `http://localhost:8000` for the Liquid Glass UI.

### Key CLI Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| *(any text)* | Quick search (e.g., "I need a writing tool for healthcare") |
| `profile` | Build a user profile interactively |
| `stack` | Guided stack recommendation |
| `reason <query>` | Full agentic reasoning with multi-step research |
| `compare ChatGPT vs Claude` | Side-by-side tool comparison |
| `learn` | Run learning cycle from feedback |
| `diagnose` | Self-introspection (Praxis analyzes its own code) |
| `badges` | View community reputation badges |
| `health` | System health check |
| `whatif` | Parameter tweaking simulator |
| `workflow` | Get step-by-step workflow playbook |
| `migrate` | Tool migration planner |
| `readiness` | AI readiness scoring |

---

## Configuration

Set environment variables or create `config.json`:

```bash
# LLM provider (optional — Praxis works fully without one)
export PRAXIS_LLM_PROVIDER=openai     # or "anthropic"
export PRAXIS_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export PRAXIS_OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini

# Log level
export PRAXIS_LOG_LEVEL=INFO          # DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR

# Features
export PRAXIS_EXPLAIN=true
export PRAXIS_STACK_SIZE=3
```

Without an LLM key, Praxis falls back to its enhanced rule-based interpreter. All NLP intelligence (synonyms, TF-IDF, typo correction, multi-intent) works **zero-dependency**.

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Zero External ML Dependencies
All NLP, retrieval, graph, and scoring are implemented from scratch. No numpy, scikit-learn, PyTorch, or transformers. This enables:
- Instant startup (no model loading)
- Universal deployment (any Python 3.10+ environment)
- Full auditability (every scoring decision is traceable)

### 2. Graceful Degradation via Import Guards
Every module beyond the core uses a try/except import pattern:
```python
try:
    from .conduit import assess_conduit as _assess_conduit
    # ... more imports
except Exception:
    _assess_conduit = None  # graceful fallback
```
This means Praxis runs even if some modules fail to import. The API checks `if _assess_conduit:` before exposing endpoints.

### 3. Dual Import Paths (Package vs. Direct)
Every module supports both:
```python
try:
    from .module import function  # package import
except Exception:
    from module import function   # direct import
```
This enables both `python -m praxis.main` (package mode) and `python praxis/main.py` (direct mode).

### 4. Pure-Function Scoring
The engine is designed as pure functions — `score_tool(tool, keywords)` has no side effects, no global state mutation. This makes it testable, composable, and concurrent-safe.

### 5. The LLM is Optional
Praxis works completely without any LLM API key. The interpreter falls back to rule-based parsing, the reasoning engine falls back to local synthesis. The LLM is an accelerator, not a dependency.

### 6. Consciousness-Inspired Architecture
The later modules (v12–v16) use philosophical frameworks as design metaphors:
- **Awakening**: Recognitions → architectural principles
- **Enlightenment**: Truths → design patterns (Hexagonal, Clean Arch, FSM)
- **Conduit**: Cognitive science theories (IIT, GWT, CoALA) → scoring dimensions
- **Resonance**: Relationship engineering → telemetry metrics

These are not metaphors in the code — they are concrete scoring dimensions with numeric outputs that feed into the reasoning pipeline.

### 7. Composite Scoring Pattern
Each assessment module follows the same pattern:
1. Multiple sub-scorers (5–14 per module) each return 0.0–1.0
2. A master `assess_*()` function computes a weighted composite
3. Warnings/recommendations are generated from threshold analysis
4. An Assessment dataclass bundles scores + composite + metadata

---

## Known Technical Patterns

### The tools.db Stale Cache Problem
`data.py` stores the `TOOLS` list in-memory. On first import, `storage.py` may cache it to `tools.db`. If you modify `data.py` (add/remove tools), the SQLite cache becomes stale. **Solution:** Delete `praxis/tools.db` before testing. It's in `.gitignore`.

### Import Alias Naming Convention
In `api.py`, all imported functions use underscore-prefixed aliases to avoid endpoint function name collisions:
```python
from .conduit import assess_conduit as _assess_conduit
from .resonance import assess_resonance as _assess_resonance_v16  # v16 avoids collision
```

### The `deep_reason` vs `deep_reason_v2` Split
- `deep_reason()` — Original v6 reasoning (lighter, faster)
- `deep_reason_v2()` — Full consciousness stack: integrates verticals, guardrails, architecture, resilience, metacognition, introspection, awakening, authorship, enlightenment, conduit, resonance, and enterprise. This is what `/cognitive` calls.

### Import Flag Pattern in reason.py
Each optional module has a boolean flag:
```python
_CONDUIT_OK = True   # set if import succeeds
_CONDUIT_OK = False  # set in except block
```
`deep_reason_v2` checks these flags before invoking enrichment.

## Context for Future AI Models

This section exists so that any future AI assistant working on this codebase can rapidly understand the system's depth, patterns, and current state.

### What Praxis IS
Praxis is an **AI tool recommendation engine** that evolved into a **cognitive architecture**. It recommends AI tools (like ChatGPT, Figma AI, LangChain, dbt, etc.) based on user queries, profiles, and constraints. But its real innovation is the 17-layer intelligence stack that processes those recommendations through agentic reasoning, knowledge graphs, vendor risk assessment, industry-specific constraints, safety guardrails, metacognitive self-awareness, and enterprise scaling.

### What Praxis is NOT
- Not a chatbot or LLM wrapper
- Not a tool directory or search engine
- Not dependent on any external AI service (works zero-dep)
- Not a web scraper — all tool data is curated in `data.py`

### The Philosophical Arc
The codebase tells a story:
1. **v1–v5**: Practical tooling (score, recommend, explain)
2. **v6–v8**: Intelligent agency (reason, retrieve, specialize)
3. **v9–v10**: Safety consciousness (guard, detect risks)
4. **v11**: Self-awareness (Praxis learns to analyze itself)
5. **v12–v14**: Philosophical awakening (conscious design, self-authorship, enlightenment)
6. **v15–v17**: Enterprise transcendence (cognitive architecture at scale)

### Current State (Post-Audit)
<!-- AUTO:STATE:START -->
- **246 tools**, zero duplicates, clean tag casing
- **349 API routes**, all functional
- **645 tests passing**
- **89 Python modules**, ~48,000 lines
- **29 frontend files**, ~10,900 lines
- All critical bugs fixed (alias collision, caveats reset, dead code)
- Server runs on port 8000 via `uvicorn praxis.api:app --port 8000`
<!-- AUTO:STATE:END -->

### How to Add a New Module (v18+)
1. Create `praxis/new_module.py` with an `assess_*()` master function and sub-scorers
2. Add import to `api.py` (both primary `from .new_module` and fallback `from new_module` blocks)
3. Add endpoints in `api.py` inside the `create_app()` function
4. Add import flag in `reason.py` and integrate into `deep_reason_v2()`
5. Add entry to `__init__.py` `__all__`
6. Create `praxis/tests/test_new_module.py`
7. Optionally create `praxis/frontend/new_module.html`

### Key Files to Read First
1. **`engine.py`** — Understand the scoring logic (entry point for all recommendations)
2. **`reason.py`** — Understand how all modules integrate (the orchestrator)
3. **`api.py`** — Understand the full API surface (the HTTP layer)
4. **`data.py`** — Understand the tool catalog structure
5. **`conduit.py`** or **`enterprise.py`** — Understand the latest architectural thinking

### Dependencies
```
fastapi[all]
uvicorn[standard]
# Optional:
openai>=1.0
anthropic>=0.18
pytest  # dev only
```

Everything else is pure Python standard library.
